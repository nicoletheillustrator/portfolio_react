# My Portfolio Website

This project is the build of my portfolio website, done with React js.

## Things to fix
Need to deploy examples of my websites so future employers can view what I have done and make it easy to read. Need to fix the contact buttons. 

### Recent Changes
Changed the domain name to a more professional dot com, instead of the default Netlify.
